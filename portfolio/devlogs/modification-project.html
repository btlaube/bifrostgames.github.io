                <h2>Dev Log 0: Project Creation and Exploration</h2>
                <h3>September 18, 2023</h3>
                <p>I started by creating a Unity project for both the FPS Microgame and Karting Microgame learning templates. 
                    I originally planned on using the FPS Microgame template to make a 3rd person shooter game; 
                    however, after playing around a bit with both projects and taking a look at the provided tutorials I decided to make a variation
                    of the Karting Microgame. </p>
                <p>I then went through some of the tutorials that came with the Karting Microgame template to better familiarize myself with the structure of the project.</p>
                <p>My goals for the project are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add additional driver and kart assets &lpar;maybe with a character selection screen&rpar;</li>
                    <li>Adjust player movement for smoother driving and possible include differnt "Characters" with different stats</li>
                    <li>Add a speed boost pad</li>
                    <li>Create at least 1 custom track &lpar;hopefully more&rpar;</li>
                    <li>Add custom sound effects and music</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some stretch goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a ghost driver to race against your best time</li>
                    <li>Add local multiplayer</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Dev Log 1: Making Custom Track and Adding Assets</h2>
            <h3>September 19, 2023</h3>
            <div class="image-text-container">
                <p>Today I added a speed pad to my track, which I thought would involve coding, but it came prebuilt as a prefab in the project.
                    I also got a first draft of the 1 custom track I wanted to make. I found a city asset pack on the Unity Asset Store and added
                    a few building models from the pack to my scene. I want the course to have a city theme with the track going through the city and 
                    around the buildings.

                <h2>Dev Log 2: Project Wrap-up &lpar;Crunch&rpar;</h2>
                <h3>September 24, 2023</h3>
                <p>Today was the last day I worked on the Modification Project. I spent quite a bit of time trying to implement the speed pads;
                    however, they were designed to be used only once, and I could not figure out how to get them to be reusable. In ended up scrapping 
                    the speed pads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, I finalized the track itself. Because I removed the speed pads, the course was feeling a little flat, so I added some ramps and jumps.
                    I didn't like how it felt to have a two turns in close succession, so I added a few more straights.
                    I also filled the scene with building assets to make the level feel like a city. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I added custom music I found online and added a script that increased the music's pitch on the last lap. 
                    For the music I chose a Phonk style that I think matches the asethetic of kart racing in a city. 
                    I wanted to make a color select screen for the kart, but ended up just changing the kart color to black.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent a good amount of time tweaking the player movement to feel just right. I wanted the driving speed to be fast enough without
                    launching the player off the track. In the end I would have liked to have added a drift and a jump, but the movement feels pretty good without those.

                <h2>Dev Log 3: Reflection</h2>
                <h3>September 25, 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    The project I made is a karting mini-game. It has one track with the objective of completing 3 laps. The track take you through a city
                    in an exciting drive including ups and downs, jumps, and bumps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working on this project, I learned just how rudimentary the code I have written for games has been. The code for this project was 
                    impressive, and difficult to understand. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The part of the project that I am most proud of is the track. I chose to design my own course instead of using one of the premade options.
                    I think it turned out well; however, I would have liked to have added speed pads. The jumps are fun and there is a good balance of calm road 
                    and difficult to manuever sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of the project was trying to add code that worked in tandem with the existing code, or even modifying existing 
                    code to get the outcome I wanted. Like I mentioned above, I wanted the speed pads to be multi-use instead of one-time use. I tried to edit 
                    the speed pad code, but in the end could not figure out how to make the change I wanted.
